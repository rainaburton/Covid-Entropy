Step 1: Download a sample of S-protien sequences from the NCBI website from March 2020 - March 2023 for each of the lower 48 states you wish to work with and label them acording 
to state (ex: "Alabama")

Step 2: Download .shp file of lower 48 states from Census.gov

When you run the code, it will concatinate all of the fasta files into one, read them, and calculate the average shannon entropy within the protien sequence per month.
Lastly, the program creates a gif that shows the average amount of shannon entropy in each state during each month from March 2020 - March 2023.
